       <strong>3.1 Installation Instructions and Other Documentation</strong>

<strong><em>Where can I find installation instructions?</em></strong>

The <em>Post.Office Installation Guide</em> contains detailed installation instructions. The manual is available for viewing from our web site, can be obtained independently from the FTP download page, and is included as part of the standard software download package.

Some brief (1-2 page) installation guidelines for all supported platforms are also available in the README files which can be found on our web site at http://www.software.com.

Important Information for NT Users: We’ve developed a new tool to assist you through the installation process. It includes detailed information on pre-installation requirements, the installation process, and related topics such as proper configuration of DNS records. You can open the Simple Online Support (SOS) tool by launching your browser and pointing it to: http://www.software.com/tech/sos/po-install.htm.

<strong><em>How do I download a copy of the Post.Office manual?</em></strong>

You can download a copy of the manual from our web site (www.software.com). Simply follow the links from the Products page to locate the Post.Office software. Documentation associated with the software is also listed there.

<strong>3.2 Licensing Issues</strong>

<strong><em>NT only - How do I update my license number?</em></strong>

To enter your new license number, simply re-run the Post.Office Setup program. It will give you the option to update your license or serial number. Choose the update option and proceed as instructed, entering your new license number when prompted.

Note that this is a non-destructive procedure that will update your license number but make no other changes. All of your accounts and configuration information will remain intact.

<strong><em>UNIX only - How do I update my license number?</em></strong>

You will need to re-run the Setup portion of the installation program to record your new license number. All account information will remain intact during this process.
<ol>
 	<li>Change directory to the location in which the Setup file is stored. If you originally installed Post.Office using the default locations, it will be found in either /opt/post.office (Solaris 2 users), or /usr/local/post.office (all other UNIX users).</li>
 	<li>Type ./Setup to re-run the Setup portion of the installation program. This will allow you to modify certain configuration information including your Post.Office license number.</li>
 	<li>Respond as desired to the options presented being sure to enter the new license number where appropriate. Post.Office will use the new number to replace the old one.</li>
</ol>
<strong><em>Why does a notice that my license has expired appear on my web Authentication form and in the headers of all my messages?</em></strong>

This occurs if you have been using a trial version of the software (not the 10 user free pack) and the trial period has passed. Please contact Sales@Software.com to obtain a valid license. Once a valid license number has been entered no further expiration messages will appear.

<strong>3.3 Pre-Installation Concerns</strong>

<strong><em>Why can’t I use Shared Networked Drives for Post.Office?</em></strong>

Do not utilize network drives for storage on a mail server because you would not want your partitions to be unavailable if for some reason your remote host was not accessible but your mail server was functioning.

<strong><em>Will Post.Office automatically set up new accounts to replace those already in existence on my old Mail Transport Agent (MTA)?</em></strong>

<strong>UNIX Users</strong>

Yes, if you want to replace your present host MTA with Post.Office directly, you can choose to automatically have the Install process set up Post.Office mail accounts for each login account as it replaces your old system.

<strong>NT Users</strong>

Post.Office for NT does not automatically create accounts for users, however, if you are interested in batch entering large numbers of accounts, it can be done; however, you will be required to edit existing utilities and create your own input files. Send an E-mail message to support@software.com for additional information.

<strong>3.4 Installation Error Conditions</strong>

To avoid errors during installation make sure you double check the system requirements listed in the Introduction to Post.Office section of this FAQ. Once all pre-installation requirements have been met, proceed with the installation process.

<strong><em>NT only: Why can’t I log into NT to finish installation?</em></strong>

To complete installation you need to access the Postmaster account on Post.Office, not the Post.Office NT user.

Point your browser to the location http://hostname.domainname:port

When you are at the Post.Office Authentication Screen be sure you are typing:
postmaster@yourdomainname and using the Postmaster password you entered during installation.

<strong><em>UNIX only: I am getting a UNIX Install error "gethostbyname". Why?</em></strong>

It appears that the system can't resolve the fully qualified host.domain name. Your DNS server must have this defined so that it can be resolved or you can include the long name as an alias in your /etc/hosts file on each machine. We would recommend defining it in your DNS server.

<strong><em>UNIX only: I am getting an error that says the system is "unable to write the accounts database". Why?</em></strong>

This could be caused by one of two reasons. The first is that you might not have proper permissions into the file directories specified for installation of the software. The second is if you are re-installing Post.Office on a machine and did not complete the "de-installation" instructions as defined (removing the /etc/post.office.conf file and all associated directories). Please re-perform the complete de-installation instructions covered in this document and try the installation again.

<strong><em>UNIX only: When I attempt to extract the Post.Office software I get a </em></strong><em>
</em><strong><em>tar: directory checksum error. What should I do?</em></strong>

You need to download the ftp version of Post.Office with the "bin" command first so that it downloads in binary mode. The error you are getting is what happens if the file was not transferred as a binary executable.

<strong>3.5 Upgrade Procedures</strong>

<strong><em>Will I be notified of new releases?</em></strong>

We send messages to all e-mail addresses registered with our sales department. Typically these are the e-mail addresses given at time of purchase. If you feel you are not receiving appropriate notification, please contact Sales@Software.com to verify that we have your accurate address.

You can also check our web site for information on the most recent releases.

Note: Notification messages are sent in staggered groups in an effort to avoid the frustration of unacceptably slow performance if everyone were to download the new version at the same time.

<strong><em>How do I upgrade Post.Office in NT?</em></strong>

All upgrades to Post.Office 3.0 (other than the 10 user free version) require the purchase of a new license number. If you do not have a valid 3.0 license number, please contact Sales@Software.com.

<em>Note: The same software is used for installing Post.Office version 3.0, upgrading from an earlier version (1.9.3 or 2.0), or entering a new license number to accommodate additional accounts/mailboxes. The program checks to see if Post.Office already exists, then self-adjusts to perform the necessary installation or upgrade procedure.</em>

The Post.Office upgrade operation is performing tests of considerable complexity including database regeneration. To ensure success you must back up your system prior to upgrading and allow adequate time to complete the upgrade operation. It is essential that the process run to completion without interruption.

A considerable portion of the time required for upgrade is spent resetting permissions on the various Post.Office directories. Installations with a large number of accounts, and therefore a large number of mailbox directories, should expect delays during that portion of the upgrade process. For example, it took approximately one hour to upgrade a server with 250 accounts.

<strong>Caution:</strong> If you have more than 30,000 mail accounts established on your server or if you are making use of linked mailbox directories, please contact Support@Software.com for assistance before attempting to upgrade to Post.Office version 3.0.

Please note that because Post.Office forms were significantly modified in version 3.0. <strong>Users working with customized versions of the Post.Office forms need to perform the following steps when upgrading their system to version 3.0</strong>. You cannot upgrade using old forms that were already customized; instead…
<ol>
 	<li>Get copies of the new standard forms for Post.Office version 3.0 by sending a request to Support@Software.com (ask nicely in the body of the message).</li>
 	<li>Revise the new standard forms to suit your needs.</li>
 	<li>Backup your system and upgrade the Post.Office software per instructions that follow.</li>
 	<li>Once the upgrade process is complete, re-submit your revised versions of the standard 3.0 forms for use with the upgraded system.</li>
</ol>
In addition, please note that the size of the Registry expands during upgrade. If insufficient space is available the upgrade will fail and recovery will be required. Although the exact amount of space required depends on a variety of factors including the number of Post.Office accounts currently established, a good rule of thumb is that Maximum Registry Size should be at least twice Current Registry Size. <strong>All users should verify that the Maximum Registry Size is sufficient by doing the following:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>From the Program Manager double click on the Main\Control Panel\System icons in the order indicated.</li>
 	<li>Click on the Virtual Memory button in the System window.</li>
 	<li>In the Vital Memory window check the values in the fields titled Current Registry Size and Maximum Registry Size. The maximum size should be at least twice the current size. If it is not, make the necessary correction and click on the OK button.</li>
</ol>
<strong>NT Upgrade Instructions:</strong>

To permit recovery if the upgrade process is accidentally interrupted (or fails to complete for any reason), backup instructions are included as the initial steps in the upgrade process. DO NOT omit these important first steps.
<ol>
 	<li>Back up the required Registry information by launching the Registry Editor, (REGEDT32.EXE), locating the following keys, and saving each one independently (by selecting the desired key, pulling down the Registry menu, and then choosing the Save Key command).</li>
 	<li>a) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Software.com\Post.Office
(suggested name &amp; location: anotherhost\temp\Post.OfficeRegKeyBackup)</li>
 	<li>b) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Software.com\Post.Office\MTA-Accounts
(suggested name &amp; location: anotherhost\temp\MTA-AccountsRegKeyBackup)</li>
 	<li>Back up the required file system information. The exact location of the required directories can be found via the Program Manager by double clicking on the Main\Control Panel\Post.Office icons in the order indicated. When the Post.Office applet window appears look at the bottom to determine the locations of the following items:</li>
 	<li>a) The Spooling Directory containing configuration information
(suggested name &amp; location: anotherhost\temp\Post.OfficeBackupconfig)</li>
 	<li>b) the Program Directory containing Post.Office executables
(suggested name &amp; location: anotherhost\temp\Post.OfficeBackupexecs)</li>
 	<li>c) the Mailbox Directory containing your mailbox information
(suggested name &amp; location: anotherhost\temp\Post.OfficeBackupmailbox)</li>
</ol>
Back up those directories in addition to the Registry keys mentioned in Step 1 above. The back up of the Mailbox directory, in particular, is of extreme importance as this directory is restructured during the upgrade process.

<em>Note: If you aren't already doing so, you should be backing up these items on a regular basis.</em>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Verify that you are logged on properly. If you are on a workstation or non-primary domain controller server you must be logged on as the Administrator of your host machine before running Setup.exe. Only if you are on a primary domain controller server can you log in as the Administrator of your domain.</li>
 	<li>Locate the Post.Office package either on the CD on which it was delivered, or in the directory in which you stored a downloaded version.</li>
 	<li>If you obtained the software from our web or ftp site simply double-click on the Post.Office ".exe" file. The package will self extract and the Setup program will be launched automatically. If you obtained the software on CD, double-click on the Setup.exe file.</li>
</ol>
<em>Note: The Setup program occupies only half your screen to allow for simultaneous display of Simple Online Support (SOS). SOS is intended for use as a guide during initial installation, however it contains supplemental information that may also be of interest to people upgrading their software. To access SOS, launch your browser and point it to: http://www.software.com/tech/sos/po-install.htm</em>
<ol start="6">
 	<li>The Installshield GUI will prompt you to choose one of three options: Remove, Update, or Set License Number.</li>
</ol>
Choose Update and click on the Next button. This installs all the new software and configuration files, retaining the values of any parameters you have customized and all information in your accounts database. When it's finished, the Setup program will re-start Post.Office for you.

<em>Note: You will be required to enter your 3.0 license number as one of the first steps in the upgrade process. To prevent unintended upgrades the program will not execute without a valid 3.0 license number. Please contact Sales@Software.com if you wish to purchase the required license.</em>

<strong>Caution: </strong>If you encounter a permissions error when copying the Post.Office.cpl file, you should answer "No" (don't bother to copy) and continue with the upgrade. The upgrade will complete successfully, but the Post.Office.cpl file will not be updated. You can contact Support@software.com after the upgrade to obtain the 3.0 version of that file and instructions on how to install it.

Remember, after the upgrade, any account which uses the NT integrated password feature *and* was deliberately locked by the Postmaster should be reviewed. (To determine an account's status post-upgrade, access the appropriate Account Data Form and check the response to the question "Lock Account to prevent POP3 access and configuration via Web or E-Mail?". If you wish to lock the account and prevent access, the answer should be Yes. If you do not wish to lock the account, the answer should be No.)

<strong><em>How do I upgrade Post.Office in UNIX?</em></strong>

All upgrades to Post.Office 3.0 (other than the 10 user free version) require the purchase of a new license number. If you do not have a valid 3.0 license number, please contact Sales@Software.com.

<strong>Caution:</strong> Please note that Program Delivery is turned off by the upgrade process. A reminder to re-enable Program Delivery is included in the instructions for those users to whom this feature applies.

<em>Note: If your UNIX mailboxes and POP mailboxes currently reside in the same directory, you will need to perform one additional step at the end of the upgrade process. For details, please refer to the upgrade instructions for your particular platform.</em>

Instructions for upgrading the UNIX version of Post.Office vary slightly from platform to platform. Read the appropriate section below for specific directions on upgrading your particular installation.

<strong>Solaris Upgrade Instructions:</strong>

To permit recovery if the upgrade process is accidentally interrupted, backup instructions are included among the initial steps in the upgrade process. DO NOT omit this important operation.

The following upgrade instructions assume that you have installed Post.Office in the default locations which are /opt/post.office (program executables) and /var/spool/post.office (the spooling directories). If you selected other locations you will need to adjust the instructions accordingly. To determine the current locations of your Post.Office, Program, and Mailbox directories list the contents of the /etc/post.office.conf file.
<ol>
 	<li>Log on as root.</li>
 	<li>Back up the contents of the following items:</li>
 	<li>a) /opt/post.office (the Post.Office executables)</li>
 	<li>b) /var/spool/post.office (the configuration information)</li>
 	<li>c) /var/spool/mailbox (the mailbox information)</li>
 	<li>d) /etc/post.office.conf (your configuration file)</li>
</ol>
<em>Note: If you aren't already doing so, you should be backing up these directories regularly.</em>

<strong>3.6 De-Installing Post.Office</strong>

<strong><em>How do I de-install or remove Post.Office in NT?</em></strong>

Launch and re-run the original Setup program. When prompted, select the De-Install option and proceed with the process to remove the Post.Office software.

If you are de-installing in order to re-install Post.Office, you should reboot prior to re-installing. Unfortunately (due to NT caching.), some of the Registry deletions do not take affect until the server is rebooted.

<em>Note: The Add/Remove Programs control panel applet does not properly de-install the Post.Office software. Please follow the de-installation instructions above.</em>

<strong><em>Setup.exe doesn’t see Post.Office to remove it. How can I delete it manually?</em></strong>

If your setup.exe doesn’t see Post.Office then definition for Post.Office must be missing from the CurrentControlSet Keys in the registry. You will need to delete Post.Office and all related files/directories manually.
<ol>
 	<li>Stop the Post.Office service.</li>
 	<li>Log on as the Local NT Administrator of your host (using the NT Username <em>Administrator</em>).</li>
 	<li>Define your Post.Office-User as a part of the Administrator’s Group and with the Right "Logon Locally"
<ul>
 	<li>Open your User Manager, Open the Administrator’s Group, Add your Post.Office-User as a member - OK</li>
 	<li>In your User Manager, Open Policies -&gt; User Rights -&gt; "Log on Locally" -&gt; Add -&gt; Show Users -&gt; Highlight Post.Office-User -&gt; ADD -&gt; OK -&gt; OK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Log out as Administrator and Log in as your Post.Office-User</li>
 	<li>Delete the Software.com Registry Key:
<ul>
 	<li>Run regedt32 and open the window for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</li>
 	<li>Highlight SOFTWARE\Software.com</li>
 	<li>Delete the Key Software.com (Edit -&gt; Delete)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Delete the following Service Registry keys:
<ul>
 	<li>Within HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE highlight CURRENTCONTROLSET/SERVICES/POST.OFFICE and delete that item.</li>
 	<li>Within HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE highlight CURRENTSET001/SERVICES/EVENTLOG/APPLICATION/POST.OFFICE and delete that item.</li>
 	<li>Within HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE highlight CURRENTSET003/SERVICES/EVENTLOG/APPLICATION/POST.OFFICE and delete that item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Delete the Post.Office Configuration directory. (By default it is "\winnt35\system32\spool\post.office".)
<ul>
 	<li>Run File Manager and highlight your "post.office" directory.</li>
 	<li>Delete the directory Post.Office (File - Delete)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Delete the Post.Office Mailbox directory (by default it is "\winnt35\system32\spool\post.office\mailbox").
<em>Note: If it lives under your previous directory you have already removed it.</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Run File Manager and highlight your "Mailbox" directory.</li>
 	<li>Delete the directory Mailbox (File - Delete)</li>
